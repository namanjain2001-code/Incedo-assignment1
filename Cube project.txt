Rubik's Cube
Strategy design pattern

You could switch between different solving algorithms dynamically depending on user input or the type of cube (e.g., 2x2, 3x3, etc.).
The core logic of how the cube is solved is separated into individual strategies (algorithms), making it easier to add new algorithms or change the existing ones.

we can extend the cube solver to support multiple methods or more advanced solvers without modifying the overall structure of the code.
